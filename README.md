# GWT Getting Started

Adapted from the GWT [Getting Started](http://www.gwtproject.org/gettingstarted.html) example.

### Building

This project used the [GWT Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/steffenschaefer/gwt-gradle-plugin). It includes a Gradle wrapper. After cloning this project, simply run

    $ ./gradlew gwtDev

to launch the GWT development environment.

The `MyWebApp.launch` is for use in Eclipse Neon.

The `pom.xml` was generated by GWT's `.webAppCreator`. I have not tested it.
